# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: The pen is neutral and simple. It also has different color that can be use for different thing and different color has different meaning.

* Behavioral:Its easy to use by the user to do anything, its for writing and sketching.

* Reflective: its looks good when you use it and you can determine the color you want by the color of the casing or the color you see outside this seems cool because its doesn't change. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.Behavioral qualities: The website must have functionability. Easy to see and less links with user friendly
2.Visceralqualities: add and drop link should be easily accessible without going to unncessary links
3.Reflective qualities: We need to remove unnecessary links so that we can easily go back to the visited link
